# HUDTweaks

### A fabric mod that adds better customization to the HUD.

This mod is still in beta. There are plenty of bugs left to fix and plenty of features left to add. If you want to report a bug or request a feature, please do so [here](/../../issues).

This mod doesÂ **NOT** require any other mods to function, including Fabric API.

### Mod Compatability

Other mods that add elements to the HUD can implement the HUDTweaks API. A guide can be found on the [wiki](/../../wiki). If you feel that there is anything wrong with the API that could be changed, you can open an issue or contact me directly on discord (burger#0007).
